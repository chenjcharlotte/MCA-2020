###  Background 

This GitHub repository is a portfolio created to explore musical data from the American sung-and-rapped through musical *Hamilton* by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Specifically, the song that is transcribed and analysed is *Youâ€™ll Be Back*, which is the 7th song of Act One of the musical. 

You can listen to this song and watch the video on YouTube by clicking the image below.

The content is divided into nine weeks of labs. The [first week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week1/week1.html)'s activities are to explore different types of datasets utilized by music researchers, identify a theme for the dataset, and describe the data relating to the selected theme. During the [second week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week2/week2.html), I transcribed a piece of music into MuseScore. The [third week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week3/week3.html)'s activities comprise exporting the score to MusicXML and MEI and rendering it using Verovio. Then, in the [fourth week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week4/week4.html), I generated a jSymbolic CSV file, a piano roll, a scatter plot diagram, and a pitch histogram of the piece using music 21. I created a schema assuming that I have 1,000 pieces of music in the repository and modified my MEI document according to that schema during the [fifth week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week5/week5.html). Week 6 is the reading week. During the [seventh week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week6/week6.html), I created a second version of my MEI file, fixed some errors in week 5, and added more data to enrich it, including licensing data and the source of the transcribed piece. As for the [eighth week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week8/week8.html), I identified three music tracks from freemusicarchive and created a table to note down the relevant metadata, including title, artist, composer, copyright, genre, source, etc. Then, I generated a waveform and spectrogram for each piece of music and wrote a reflection regarding their differences. In the [ninth week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week9/week9.html), I used the music pieces I downloaded during the previous week, extracted spectrogram, mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and chroma feature for each track, and generated annotation layers for each. Then, I utilized the annotation layers (CSVs) to compute and visualize histograms for each track by using Python. Lastly, I compared histograms for MFCC features. As for the [tenth week](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/Labs/week_10/week10.html), I used the Python notebook to get a similarity matrix, with the country tracks replaced by the three tracks I downloaded in previous weeks. Then, I exported the song You'll Be Back I transcribed in the second week as a wave file. I used SonicVisualizer to generate a midi file then exported the notated version from MuseScore.

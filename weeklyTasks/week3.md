## Week 3: Encoded Notation

### Task 1: MusicXml and MEI 

In the first part of the activity, I exported the music score I created last week and generated [MusicXML](https://github.com/chenjcharlotte/MCA-2020/blob/master/data/You'll_Be_Back.musicxml) and [MEI files](https://github.com/chenjcharlotte/MCA-2020/blob/master/data/Youll_Be_Back.mei). 

### Task 2: Verovio 

As for the second task, I followed the instructions and rendered the file using Verovio in GitHub.

Here is the [link](https://chenjcharlotte.github.io/MCA-2020/verovio.html) of my verovio.

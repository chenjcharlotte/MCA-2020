 ###  Background 
 
This GitHub repository is a portfolio created to explore musical data from the American sung-and-rapped through musical *Hamilton* by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Specifically, the song that is transcribed and analysed is *You’ll Be Back*, which is the 7th song of Act One of the musical. 

You can listen to this song and watch the video on YouTube by clicking the image below.

The content is divided into 9 weeks of labs. The activities from the [first week](https://github.com/chenjcharlotte/MCA-2020/blob/master/weeklyTasks/week1.md) are to explore different types of datasets that are utilised by music researchers, to identify a theme for dataset, and to describe the data relating to the selected theme. During the [second week](https://github.com/chenjcharlotte/MCA-2020/blob/master/weeklyTasks/week2.md), I transcribed a piece of music into MuseScore. The [third week](https://github.com/chenjcharlotte/MCA-2020/blob/master/weeklyTasks/week3.md)’s activities comprise exporting the score to MusicXML and MEI and rendering it using Verovio. Then, in the [fourth week](https://github.com/chenjcharlotte/MCA-2020/blob/master/weeklyTasks/week4.md), I generated a jSymbolic CSV file, a piano roll, a scatter plot diagram, and pitch histogram of the piece by using music 21. I created a schema assuming that I have 1,000 pieces of music in the repository and modified my MEI document according to that schema during the [fifth week](https://github.com/chenjcharlotte/MCA-2020/blob/master/weeklyTasks/week5.md).
